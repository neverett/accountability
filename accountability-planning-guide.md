# Accountability planning

If your work involves managing or processing data about people, follow the steps in this guide to develop a plan for holding yourself accountable to the [neveragain.tech pledge](http://neveragain.tech). (Note: You do not have to be a signatory of the pledge to hold yourself accountable to it.)

 While you can work through this guide alone, your personal commitments will be more effective when amplified by a collective voice. We recommend meeting with other people in your organization who are concerned about similar issues; some of them have chosen to make their names public on [neveragain.tech](https://neveragain.tech).

In creating a guide for a broad audience, we may have missed topics or questions relevant to your specific situation. Feel free to include them in your planning if needed.
